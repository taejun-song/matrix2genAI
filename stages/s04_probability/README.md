# Stage 04: Probability and Statistics

**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Prerequisites**: s02, s03
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐☆☆☆

## What You'll Learn

Probability is fundamental to machine learning. You'll implement:
- Common probability distributions
- Statistical estimators (mean, variance, covariance)
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
- Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation

## Why This Matters

- **Probabilistic models**: Bayesian networks, HMMs
- **Loss functions**: Cross-entropy is from information theory
- **Uncertainty**: Confidence intervals, Bayesian inference
- **Generative models**: VAEs, diffusion models use probability
